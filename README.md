# Character Bank for the Creatively Bankrupt

This project allows a user to log in and store basic RPG character templates for their campaigns.

## My plan / approach
- My approach to this project is to first build up a basic crud app that will perform the most basic functions required. From there I will branch out and add on features.
## Cool tech that I used
 - Utilised heroku to deploy my app online.

 - Use of databases to store users and characters created by the user.

 - Using industry standard password encrpytion to secure user passwords from theft.


## Lessons I learned
- Implementation of industry standard password encryption.
- Linking databases so users can only view what characters they have created.
- Gained experience in deploying apps.
## Features to add in the future
- More mobile first design
